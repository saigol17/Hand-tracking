# Hand-tracking
This is the base model which is detecting the hands and drawing the lines on them. I am still research on American Sign Language (ASL) works and how each alphabet is gestured. There are different ways on how the words are gestured rather than putting the alphabets of the words together. I am getting back into training the words and alphabet model next. 
I have used the mediapipe dataset and work through their built-in libaries and functions to put the detection together.
